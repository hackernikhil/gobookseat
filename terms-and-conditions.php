				<h3>3. Bookings over the Platform</h3>
				<p>If you choose to enter into a transaction with a Supplier for the booking of Transportation Services, you agree and understand that you are entering into an agreement with the Supplier and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with Transportation Services imposed by the Supplier. You acknowledge and agree that we only sell tickets and are not the operator of the Transportation Services, and that, with the exception of our obligation to reserve the Transportation.</p>
				
				<p>Service and to transfer the payment hereunder, we disclaim all liability arising from or related to the Transportation Service provided or any such agreements between you and the Supplier. Upon your payment of the ticket price of the specific Transportation Services to Gobookseat, your payment obligation to the Supplier is fulfilled, and Gobookseat will remit to the Supplier the respective payment.</p>
				
				<p>We process payments through a third party PSP (payment service provider). The Listing for a Transportation Service specifies the final ticket price (the “Ticket Price”). As noted above the Supplier is required to either confirm or decline the booking within 48 hours of when the booking is requested. If a requested booking is declined (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Supplier), the full Ticket Price collected by Gobookseat will be refunded to you, and any pre-authorization of your credit card will be released, if applicable, and you acknowledge we will refund these amounts as soon as practicable.</p>
				
				<p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Gobookseat or to the third-party payment processor. You agree to pay Gobookseat for any confirmed bookings made in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods as may be described on the Platform, e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, via a third party online PSP or by one of the other payment methods as may be described on the Platform. If you are directed to supplier’s third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking and providing a booking reference number.</p>
				
				<p>WHILE FOR MOST SUPPLIERS THE EMAIL WITH THE CONFIRMED BOOKING IS SUFFICIENT, THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH THE EMAIL CONFIRMATION ONLY CONTAINS A VOUCHER THAT YOU NEED TO SHOW IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE ACTUAL BOARDING TICKET. IN SUCH CASES THE LISTING AND THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL WILL CONTAIN DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE TICKET COLLECTION.</p>
			
				<h3>Notices</h3>
				<p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>
				
				<h3>Changes and Cancellations</h3>
				<p>Travelers may contact the respective supplier to request for change or to cancel their booking. Refunds will not be offered by Gobookseat and we will accept no liability if a Traveler decides to cancel or change the booking after a transaction is completed.</p>
				
				<p>IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN RECEIVE THE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AT THE AGREED TIME AND PLACE. NO REFUND CAN BE GIVEN IF YOU ARRIVE LATER THAN THE AGREED TIME TO THE AGREED STATION, PLATFORM OR DEPARTURE POINT AND THEREFORE MISS A JOURNEY OR TRIP. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ARRIVE AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED TIME TO THE AGREED STARTING OR PICK-UP POINT, WITH THE EMAIL WITH THE CONFIRMED BOOKING – AFTER YOU COLLECTED THE VOUCHER (IF NEEDED).</p>
				
				<p>Gobookseat accepts no liability if a Traveler is refused access to Transportation Services, or is requested to leave a vehicle, due to the Traveler’s inappropriate, offensive, wild, violent or dangerous behavior, including but not limited to substance abuse, drunkenness, misconduct or inappropriate exposure.</p>
				
				<h3>6. International Travel</h3>
				<p>Travelers are responsible for ensuring that they meet foreign entry requirements and that their travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met during the time of traveling. We urge Travelers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to or within international destinations.</p>
				
				<p>GOBOOKSEAT ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY IF YOU ARE REFUSED ACCESS TO ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICE(S) OR INTO ANY COUNTRY DUE TO YOUR FAILURE TO CARRY THE CORRECT AND ADEQUATE PASSPORT, VISA, OR OTHER TRAVEL DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY ANY SUPPLIER, AUTHORITY, OR COUNTRY, INCLUDING COUNTRIES OF TRANSIT.</p>
				
				<h3>7. Non Endorsement</h3>
				<p>Gobookseat does not endorse or assume responsibility for any Suppliers or any Transportation Service. In addition, although we require Suppliers to provide accurate information, we cannot confirm or verify the terms of each single transaction. We advise travelers to exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property when determining the identity of Suppliers who you contact via the Platform and suitability of Transportation Services that you book via the Platform. Accordingly, we encourage you to take independent measures to confirm the terms of each journey you book via the Services. Gobookseat will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services, other than as provided herein.</p>
				
				<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE THE BOOKING OF TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER RELEVANT TRAVEL SERVICES. GOBOOKSEAT CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTING AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. GOBOOKSEAT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE AT THE TRAVELER’S OWN RISK.</p>
				
				<h3>8. Third Parties’ Links, Websites, and Services</h3>
				<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not affiliated with those websites, have no control over those websites, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites. In addition, we will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.</p>
				
				<p>If you access any third party’s website, service, or content from our Services, you do so at your own risk. By using the Services, you expressly release us (and our owners, employees, agents, affiliates, and/or licensors) from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, information, materials, products, or services. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you have left the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
				
				<p>We permit you to link to materials on the Services for personal, non-commercial use only.</p>
